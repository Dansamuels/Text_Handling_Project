Char C allows the programmer to write directly to memory unlike most of other programming languages. Key constructs in C such as pointers and arrays are designed to structure and manipulate memory in a machine-independent fashion. Thirty-two Keywords in C are also called as reserved words such as char int float or goto, and void. C gives control over the memory layout of data structures! C is a strongly typed language. This means that the variable type cannot be changed once it is declared. Here, the type of number variable is int. You cannot assign a floating-point (decimal) value 5.5 to this variable. Also, you cannot redefine the data type of the variable to double. By the way, to store the decimal values in C, you need to declare its type to either double or float. C provides a uniform interface when dealing with low-level code such as the part of the OS that controls a device. Do these capabilities exist in most other languages? Answer is null..
