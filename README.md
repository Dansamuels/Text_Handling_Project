# Text_Handling_Project
This program asks the user for a text file. The program then reads and prints the contents of this file to the command line. It starts a new line when certain keywords and or punctuation marks are read in from the text file.<br> In this project I learnt how  to read and write from files in c. I also learnt how handle text read from the file in C.
